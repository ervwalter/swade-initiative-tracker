# PRD ‚Äî Owlbear Rodeo Extension: SWADE Initiative (Just-Enough)

## 1) Product Vision
Create a **minimal, analog-feeling initiative helper** for Savage Worlds Adventure Edition (SWADE) games in Owlbear Rodeo (OBR).  
It should **behave like a shared deck at a physical table**, while removing only the logistical pain: deal, sort, hold, simple replacement draws, late joiners, and an optional GM privacy mode.  
**No dice automation. No Bennies tracking. No rules enforcement beyond card order and deck state.**

---

## 2) Goals & Non-Goals
### 2.1 Goals
- **Manage the Action Deck** (single shared deck per encounter; discard; reshuffle after Joker).
- **Deal initiative** at the start of each round.
- **Sort order correctly**: Ace high to Two; tie by **Spades > Hearts > Diamonds > Clubs**; **Jokers at the top**, act anytime.
- **Hold bookkeeping**: mark a unit On Hold; they keep their current card for the rest of that round, **aren‚Äôt dealt** at the next round‚Äôs deal if still holding, and can **Act Now** to re-enter.
- **Inactive/Incapacitated flag**: unit remains listed but **does not draw**.
- **Simple replacement draw**: a **Draw Additional Card** button; show *all* cards drawn this round for that unit; the owner **picks the keeper** (table decides best/worst).
- **Late joiners**: add mid-round (deal now) or join next round (no card yet).
- **Light permissions**: **GM can change anyone**; players can only change their own.
- **Optional GM privacy**: Non-player (GM-controlled) cards shown **face-down to players** (GM sees all).

### 2.2 Non-Goals
- No Bennies ledger, Joker‚Äôs Wild payouts, Conviction, damage, or status automation.
- No dice rolls or opposed-check facilitators.
- No automatic interpretation of edges/hindrances (the **table** decides which card to keep).

---

## 3) Rules Basis (what we mirror, not enforce)
- **One 54-card Action Deck** (two Jokers).  
- **Deal each round**; **shuffle after any round with a Joker** seen.  
- **Countdown**: Ace ‚Üí Two; ties by **S > H > D > C**.  
- **Jokers**: act anytime; (+2 reminders may be displayed, but not applied).  
- **Hold**: may delay within the round; **if still holding into the next round, don‚Äôt get a new card**; when you act, you re-enter the order; after acting normally, you‚Äôll be dealt at the next round start again.  
- **Extras may share a card** (grouped row).

> *Design intent:* keep the extension ‚Äúbookkeeping-only,‚Äù with reminders that resemble table chatter, not a rules engine.

---

## 4) Personas
- **GM Gina (primary)**: Wants deck handling, clean order, quick **Hold**/**Act Now**, optional hidden NPC cards, and authority to fix anything.
- **Player Priya**: Wants to see her card clearly, draw replacement(s) when allowed, choose the keeper herself, and toggle Hold.

---

## 5) User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### US1 ‚Äî Deal & Sort
**As a GM**, I click **Deal Round** to give one card to every eligible participant and auto-sort the order.  
**AC:**
- Wild Cards draw individually; Extras may be grouped to one shared row.
- Sorted Ace‚ÜíTwo; suit tiebreaker S>H>D>C; Jokers pinned at top.
- If any Joker is dealt this round, a **‚Äúreshuffle at round end‚Äù** flag appears.

### US2 ‚Äî Hold (bookkeeping only)
**As a player/GM**, I can **toggle Hold** on a participant.  
**AC:**
- When set during a round, the card remains visible for that round; the row is marked **On Hold**.
- On the next **Deal Round**, **On Hold rows are skipped** (no new card).
- **Act Now** inserts the row back into the current countdown (table handles any contest off-tool).
- Clearing Hold restores normal dealing on subsequent rounds.

### US3 ‚Äî Inactive / Incapacitated
**As a GM**, I can mark a participant **Inactive** while keeping them listed.  
**AC:**
- Inactive rows are clearly greyed.
- Inactive rows **never draw** until reactivated.

### US4 ‚Äî Replacement Draw (simple & universal)
**As a player/GM**, I can press **Draw Additional Card** to add one more card to my choices.  
**AC:**
- Each press draws exactly **one** additional card into a **Card Chooser**.
- The chooser shows the **initial card** plus all **additional** cards drawn this round for that row.
- The **owner selects the keeper**; non-kept cards go to **discard**.
- No automatic ‚Äúbest/worst‚Äù enforcement‚Äî**table decides**.

### US5 ‚Äî Late Joiners & Groups
**As a GM**, I can add a participant mid-combat.  
**AC:**
- Options: **Deal now** (immediate card) or **Join next round** (no card yet).
- I can **group Extras** to a single row; group draw yields one card for the group.

### US6 ‚Äî GM Privacy Mode (Face-Down NPC Cards)
**As a GM**, I can keep non-player cards hidden from players.  
**AC:**
- Setting: **NPC/GM-controlled cards face-down to players**; GM sees values.
- Player view shows hidden cards with a placeholder (e.g., ‚ÄúüÇ†‚Äù) but still lists the row in its sorted position.  
  > *Note:* This reveals **relative order** but not **exact values**; it matches the ‚Äúcountdown surprise‚Äù feel with minimal complexity.
- Optional per-row **Reveal** control for the GM.

### US7 ‚Äî Permissions
**As a GM**, I control the encounter; **as a player**, I control my rows.  
**AC:**
- **Players**: can toggle Hold/Act Now on their rows, draw replacement(s), choose keeper.
- **GM**: can do the above for anyone, plus: add/remove/group rows, override keeper, set Inactive, toggle privacy mode, deal/end round.

## 6) Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Deck Management
- Single **Action Deck** per encounter: `remaining[]`, `discard[]`, `reshuffleFlag:boolean`.
- **Reshuffle** happens automatically at **End Round** if any Joker was seen.
- All non-kept replacement cards are moved to **discard** immediately.

### 6.2 Participants & Grouping
- Participant types: `PC`, `NPC-Wild`, `Extras-Group`.
- A **group** holds 1..N tokens but **one card** per round.
- **Inactive** flag removes a row from dealing without removing it from the list.

### 6.3 Dealing & Sorting
- **Deal Round** gives 1 card to each **eligible** row:  
  - Skips rows with `status=Inactive`.  
  - Skips rows with `status=OnHold` (carryover).  
- Sorting: **Joker(s)** at top (acts anytime) ‚Üí **rank** (A high to 2) ‚Üí **suit** (S>H>D>C).

### 6.4 Hold Lifecycle
- `Hold` toggle adds a **HOLD** badge but **does not remove** the current card mid-round.
- At next dealing phase, held rows are **not dealt** and show **no card** (still holding).
- `Act Now` clears Hold and reinserts the row into the current round‚Äôs order (GM places appropriately).

### 6.5 Replacement Draws
- Button: **Draw Additional Card** (each press = +1 card).
- **Card Chooser** modal/grid displays all current choices for that row this round.
- **Keep This** selects the keeper; others ‚Üí discard.
- Choice events logged (for transparency).

### 6.6 Late Joiners
- GM can **Add Participant** ‚Üí choose **Deal now** or **Join next round**.
- **Remove** keeps the deck intact; removed card (if any) ‚Üí discard.

### 6.7 Privacy (GM View vs Player View)
- Global setting: **Hide NPC cards from players** (default OFF).
- **GM view** always shows actual cards and full order.
- **Player view** shows:  
  - PCs: actual cards.  
  - NPCs: üÇ† placeholder (still sorted in visible order).  
- GM can **Reveal** any individual NPC card at will.

### 6.8 Permissions
- Ownership per row (GM assignable).
- **Players** can act on owned rows only; **GM** can act on any row.
- All actions protected client-side and validated in shared state (room authority = GM).

---

## 7) UX Design (minimal)

### 7.1 Main Bar
- **[Start Deck] [Deal Round] [End Round] [Reshuffle after round: ON/OFF (auto)] [Add Participant] [Settings]**

### 7.2 Turn List (sorted)
Row example:
```

\[üÉûQ‚ô†]  Kyra (PC)     \[Hold/Act Now] \[Draw Additional Card] \[‚ãÆ]
\[üÉèJoker] Goblins (Grp)  JOKER ‚Äì acts anytime (+2 reminder)   \[Hold/Act Now] \[‚ãÆ]
\[üÇ†]     Bandit Boss (NPC)  (Hidden to players)               \[Hold/Act Now] \[Draw Additional Card] \[Reveal] \[‚ãÆ GM]

````
- Icons: **HOLD** badge; **INACTIVE** greys the row.
- **‚ãÆ** menu (GM): Set Inactive/Active, Group/Ungroup, Assign Owner, Remove, Override Keeper.

### 7.3 Card Chooser Modal
- Title: ‚ÄúChoose your card for **Merisiel**‚Äù
- Grid of card tiles (initial + each additional draw)
- Buttons on each tile: **Keep This**
- Footer: ‚ÄúOthers will be discarded.‚Äù (Cancel = no selection change)

---

## 8) Data Model (minimal)

```ts
type Suit = 'S'|'H'|'D'|'C';
type Card = { id: string; rank: 2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|'J'|'Q'|'K'|'A'|'JOKER'; suit?: Suit };

interface DeckState {
  remaining: Card[];
  discard: Card[];
  reshuffleAfterRound: boolean;
  round: number;
}

type Status = 'Active'|'OnHold'|'Inactive';

interface Participant {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  controller: 'GM'|'PlayerId';
  type: 'PC'|'NPC-Wild'|'Extras-Group';
  status: Status;
  currentCard?: Card;             // absent if OnHold crossing into a new round or Inactive
  drawChoices: Card[];            // initial + additional this round
  isHiddenToPlayers?: boolean;    // driven by Privacy setting & controller=GM
  members?: string[];             // for group rows
}
````

---

## 9) State & Round Flow

1. **Start Deck** ‚Üí create deck; round=1; discard=\[]; reshuffleAfterRound=false.
2. **Add participants** (optionally group).
3. **Deal Round** ‚Üí for each participant with `status=Active` (and not OnHold):

   * draw 1 to `currentCard` & `drawChoices=[card]`;
   * set `reshuffleAfterRound=true` if card is Joker.
4. **Sort** by Joker ‚Üí rank ‚Üí suit.
5. **During round**:

   * **Hold** toggled: badge on; card remains for this round.
   * **Draw Additional Card**: push into `drawChoices`; open chooser; on **Keep**, move non-kept to `discard` and set `currentCard`.
   * **Act Now** (from Hold): clear Hold; insert into order (GM chooses exact placement).
6. **End Round**:

   * Discard all `currentCard`s;
   * If any Joker seen: **shuffle** (`discard + remaining`);
   * For rows still **OnHold**: **do not deal** next round and **clear `currentCard`**;
   * round++.

---

## 10) Non-Functional Requirements

* **Simplicity**: <= 2 clicks for GM to start/deal each round.
* **Clarity**: Large card glyphs, suit icons, concise badges (HOLD/INACTIVE/JOKER).
* **Reliability**: Single shared state source; GM is authoritative.
* **Performance**: Handle 40+ rows (large encounters) without perceptible lag.
* **Auditability**: Minimal action log: deal, replacement choice, hold toggle, reveal.

---

## 11) Configuration

* **Privacy**: ‚ÄúHide NPC cards from players‚Äù (default OFF).
* **Allow player self-management**: ON (players can Hold/Act Now, draw additional, choose keeper).
* **GM override**: always available.

---

## 12) Acceptance Tests

1. **Deal & Sort**

   * Given 3 PCs, 1 NPC-Wild, 2 Extras grouped ‚Üí after **Deal Round**: each eligible row has 1 card; order is Joker ‚Üí rank (A‚Üí2) ‚Üí suit (S>H>D>C).

2. **Joker Reshuffle Flag**

   * When any Joker appears, **reshuffleAfterRound** flag is set; on **End Round**, deck shuffles and flag clears.

3. **Hold Across Rounds**

   * If a PC toggles **Hold** mid-round, they keep their card for the rest of that round.
   * If still holding at **End Round**, they are **not dealt** at the next **Deal Round**; their row shows **no card** but remains **On Hold**.
   * **Act Now** reinserts them; subsequent rounds deal normally if not holding.

4. **Inactive Rows**

   * Marking a row **Inactive** prevents it from receiving cards on **Deal Round** while keeping it visible.

5. **Replacement Draws**

   * Pressing **Draw Additional Card** adds exactly one more card to the chooser.
   * Choosing a keeper sets `currentCard` to that card; others go to discard.
   * Multiple presses accumulate multiple choices.

6. **Late Joiners**

   * Adding a participant **Deal now** assigns a card immediately; **Join next round** adds with no card until next deal.

7. **GM Privacy**

   * With privacy ON, GM sees all card faces; players see üÇ† for NPC rows; ordering remains visible to players, values hidden.
   * **Reveal** shows an NPC‚Äôs card to players.

8. **Permissions**

   * Player can only modify their own row(s); GM can modify any row.

---

## 13) Open Questions (for the team)

* **Face-down ordering leak**: Do we keep NPC rows sorted (revealing relative order) or collapse them under a ‚ÄúHidden NPCs‚Äù bucket until reveal? (Current spec: keep sorted, just hide value for minimal complexity.)
* **Group management UX**: From OBR tokens or from the list? (Current spec: both; MVP can be list-only.)

---

## 14) Future (nice-to-have, *not* in MVP)

* Player-side **Countdown bar** that highlights the current rank.
* Optional **single card draw** utility outside encounters (same deck object).
* Visual themes (card backs/skins), compact mode, reversible suit-order variant.
