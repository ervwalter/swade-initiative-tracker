# Savage Worlds Initiative

An Action Deck initiative tracker for Savage Worlds Adventure Edition (SWADE) games in Owlbear Rodeo.

This extension brings SWADE's unique card-based initiative system to your virtual tabletop, managing a standard 54-card deck with proper SWADE sorting and mechanics.

## Key Features

- **Automated Card Dealing**: Draws cards from a standard 54-card deck (52 cards + 2 Jokers)
- **SWADE Initiative Order**: Proper sorting with Jokers first, then Ace to 2, with suit precedence (Spades > Hearts > Diamonds > Clubs)
- **Hold & Act Now**: Full support for held actions and interrupts
- **Token Integration**: Add combatants directly from map tokens via right-click context menu
- **NPC Card Privacy**: Hide NPC cards from players until their turn comes up
- **Card Replacement**: Draw multiple cards and choose which to keep (for Quick/Level Headed edges)
- **Automatic Reshuffling**: Deck reshuffles after any round containing a Joker

### Adding Combatants
